=========================================================================================
=== HIGH PRIORITY
=========================================================================================

[ NEXT ]
- Prepare for Dominic Jebsen case
- Rest Client preview test 
- Add name to all endpoint
- non-blocking file write
  - All APIs that will generate images need worker
  - However, if the API needs to download the file, it will wait for the completion of image generation
    Otherwise, it will returns ASAP
- Mongo log, cost calculation
- image API supports pdf-image and doc
- log worker
- Swivel-common: rate-limiting, compressPrompt 

[ NEXT ]
- move to WSL?
- WSL Ctrl-c, multi processing/threading graceful exit
- If parent process does not exist, exit the worker process automatically

[ blocking issue ]
- will write images blocks?

[Misc]
- Response fileUrl
  - path should include API endpoint
  - add full URL

[ BUG ]
- /pdf/upload/extractFullText
  isGen: false, is GenRoi: false but fileUrl will generate

[ Performance tuning ]
- Paddle queue, one image per job? A large pdf, say 50 pages, will occupy a while queue?
- How many paddle processes can run on a GPU server?

[ Airway bill ]
- Airway bill pre-processing?

[ Misc ]
- common onFull_() 
- Housekeeping worker

=========================================================================================
=== NORMAL PRIORITY
=========================================================================================

[ Deployment concern ] 
- Migrate all code to dev and test on WSL
- Well test the multi-threading and process behavior 
- Test nginx reverse proxy and custom headers
  extract real list of HOST, PORT, URL

[ Swagger API doc ]
- How to document different http exit code, e.g. 422, 401, 422

[ doc tools ] 
- From xls, doc, pdf-image, pdf-text to images

[ API error and other errors ]
- internal and external error... 
- differentiate 500 with wrong file, e.g. pdf uploaded as image

[ server ]
- Handle port already been used error

[ API limits ]
- control upload size?
- JWT rate limiting

[ info/status API ]
- get status

[ performance tuning ]
- Write multiple image faster.. using MP worker? skimage.io.multisave?

[ freeze packages ]
- PaddleOCR + dependent files

=========================================================================================
=== LOW PRIORITY
=========================================================================================
[ admin API ]
- get ver
- get status
- For API /decodeToken, it needs admin rights

[ documentation ]
- Use markdown for function, types, class documentation
- Refer to Edwood code

[ WSL/Ubuntu ]
- GPUInfo raise utf-8 error
- After CTRL-C, process are not killed

[ pypdfium2 ]
- If pypdfium2 has better performance converting pdf to images                

[ file upload ]
- time out multipart/form-data

[ app config ]
- max file size, e.g 10MB
- max page to process, e.g. 10
- no. of multi-thread worker for pdf2image
